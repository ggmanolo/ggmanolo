# Manuel Garcia Genta — Personal Website

This repository contains the source code of my personal website and portfolio.

Beyond showcasing my work, this project reflects how I approach frontend architecture, UI engineering, and performance-driven interfaces.

## About Me

I'm a Senior Frontend & UI Engineer specializing in React and Next.js.  
I build product-focused, visually refined web applications with strong technical and design standards.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- SCSS Modules
- GSAP (animations)
- Structured Data (SEO optimization)

## Technical Approach

This project is intentionally built with:

- Component-driven architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Performance considerations (lazy loading, optimized assets)
- Semantic HTML and accessibility best practices
- Structured metadata for SEO

The hero animation is powered by GSAP timelines and IntersectionObserver to ensure controlled entrance transitions and smooth performance.

## Why This Project Matters

This website represents how I merge engineering and design:

- Thoughtful motion
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Product-oriented decisions
- Maintainable frontend structure

It’s not just a portfolio — it’s a representation of how I build.
